National food: meat pie and Vegemite.
Australia does not have an officially declared national dish, but some of its most iconic foods include meat pies, roast lamb, pavlova, lamingtons, Vegemite, and barbecued sausages, reflecting both Indigenous traditions and multicultural influences.
Australia is known for its diverse culinary scene, which incorporates flavors and ingredients from around the world, thanks to its multicultural population.
The meat pie is a popular savory pastry filled with minced meat and gravy, often enjoyed as a quick snack or meal. Vegemite, a dark, savory spread made from yeast extract, is commonly eaten on toast or crackers and is a staple in many Australian households.
