National animals: emu and kangaroo.
The national bird of Australia is the emu, a large, flightless bird native to the country. The emu is known for its impressive speed and endurance, capable of running at speeds up to 50 kilometers per hour. It is a symbol of progress and forward movement, as it cannot walk backward easily.
The kangaroo is another iconic Australian animal and serves as a national symbol. Kangaroos are marsupials, meaning they carry and nurse their young in a pouch. They are known for their powerful hind legs, which allow them to leap great distances. Kangaroos are found throughout Australia in various habitats, from forests to grasslands.
Both the emu and kangaroo are featured on the Australian coat of arms, representing the country's unique wildlife and the idea of moving forward, as neither animal can move backward easily. These animals hold significant cultural and ecological importance in Australia and are celebrated in various forms of art, literature, and tourism.
