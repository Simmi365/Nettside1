The Great Emu War took place in 1932 after world war 1 a lot of veterans were given land to farm, and by the time of the Great Depression they face challenges like falling wheat prices an failing crops.
<br><br>
Because of these challenges around 20000 emus immigrated to the region which caused a good amount of damage.
<br><br>
The military was called in to deal with the emu problem, and they used machine guns to try and curb the population.
<br><br>
Despite their efforts, the emus proved to be elusive and difficult to catch, leading to a series of failed attempts to reduce their numbers.
<br><br>
The Great Emu War ultimately ended in failure for the military, and the emus continued to thrive in the region.
<br><br>
The event has since become a humorous and somewhat legendary episode in Australian history, highlighting the challenges of wildlife management and the resilience of the emu population.
